# Interactive Story telling Game
## About the Project
  
This project aims to create  
an interactive Webadventure  
to satisfy the needs of our professor.

## What the Project Aims to be
  
We will try to integrate a DnD-like  
game in which the player will be able  
to guide throught the fast lands  
and interact with diffrent friends   
and foes. This will be done with a  
text-based descision making console.  
Therefore the joices made matter and  
it is infinitly replayable.  
  
Hope you enjoy!!! >U<
